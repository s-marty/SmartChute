![Mini Player](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s-marty/SmartChute/master/images/mostviewed.png)

## Smarty Menu

**Use Blacklist** will block all videos from the blocked channels you have added using the X icon in the upper left corner of the video thumbnails shown on the main page (ALL), POPULAR page, TRENDING pages and the carousels. To unblock, 
simply click the desired channel name at the bottom of the menu

The **Scroll Menubar** option will un-fix the upper header when the page scrolls downward, freeing valuable screen real estate. 
The page specific navigation menu will follow a similar pattern. Up-scrolling will reveal both.

**Hide Carousel** hides the carousel as well as disabling the processor-draining slide cycles.

**Hide Comments** is a popular request by those who do not need to see what other (mostly fake) users are droning about. 
There is a button on each page to temporally view the comments for that video.

The **Popular Playlist** selection will display a play list of that channels 10 most viewed videos below the video information and above the comments (button.)

Selecting **All Playlists** will display any playlists created by the owner of the channel. If any, they will be located above the comment section.

Selecting **Use Miniplayer** and then scrolling down, will display a scaleable moveable mini video player without interruption.

**Auto Play Video** will play or stop the video when the page first loads. Some browsers require user interaction on the first video before playing.

**Hide Unsafe Ads** will disable and hide the ad box. These ads are not from bitchute.com, but outside advertisers who can, and do supply links to dangerous pages.

The four color selection choices select an optional text color when using night (black page) mode. They do nothing in day mode. Left box is **None**, then **Orange**, **Blue**, and **Green**.

The bottom menu section contains a scrollable list of blocked, annoying, fake, ridiculous, propagandistic, repetitive, lunatic, or just plain undesired channels that do not need to be seen. 
Clicking on the channel name will remove it from the list.

**Seekbar Preview**
<br/>
Runnimg the mouse pointer over the seekbar will popup a video frame capture near to that position as with some other video players.
This feature will naturally slow down your browser to some degree. Therefore you may wish to disable it via the Additional Features Menu if you are using an older browser or are on a slow internet network connection.
The additional download bandwidth is approximately 8 mB for a 640x360 video of any length.
The tiny images are loaded asynchronously in the background from left to right, and remain blank until that point is reached.
Please note that canvas blocking software or addons will cripple this feature.
